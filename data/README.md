# Data Overview

Simulated datasets and corresponding GRNs can be found under `/sc_simulated_data`, for varying number of simulated TFs.

FDR controlled GRNs based on thirty GTEx tissue datasets can be found on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17581025). This includes both "groundtruth" (DIANE-like) P-values as well as approximate P-values computed by SignifiKANTE.
